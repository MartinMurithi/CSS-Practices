-> Inline, an element will not start in a new line, behaves as a span, takes the remainng available width
    eg, i, span, a, img. Is not affected with width or height
-> Inline block, same as inline, but the difference is that it takes width and height
-> Block, takes up the whole width, ie, no other element can be on its left or right side.
