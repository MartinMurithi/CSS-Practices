    1. Relative, Relative length units are relative to another element's size or settings
        eg,  rem, %, em, vh, vw
    2. Absolute, Absolute length units are based on an actual physical unit, and are generally considered to be the same size across devices, ie, they do not change even if screen sizes changes
